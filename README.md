#ArtistView

ArtistView is a full stack application that provides users a seemless way to browse through an artist's songs and albums. Each page is dedicated to one specific artist. The application has fully functioning audio capabilities.

This repository holds the albums component. The component classifies albums by various categories and displays them in a way that makes sense to the user. Each album is clickable and the first song in the album will play on click.
